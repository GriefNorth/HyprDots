# SBHD – A Modern Hyprland Experience

Welcome to SBalghari HyprDots – a polished, feature-rich configuration for Arch Linux and Hyprland, a dynamic tiling Wayland compositor. Designed for aesthetics, efficiency, and full functionality, SBHD delivers a refined, seamless, and modern desktop experience.

## Features

- A clean, efficient, and fully optimized configuration for [Hyprland](https://github.com/vaxerski/hyprland), providing a smooth tiling window management experience.  

- A stylish and functional status bar using [Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar), featuring tray icons, weather updates, music controls, system monitoring, and more, with extensive customization options.  

- A sleek and dynamic application launcher powered by [Rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi), featuring pywal integration for automatic color adaptation based on the current wallpaper.  

- A modern notification system powered by [SwayNC](https://github.com/ErikReider/SwayNotificationCenter), offering a centralized control center for managing notifications efficiently.  

- A user-friendly and interactive shell experience with auto-suggestions and syntax highlighting, combining the power of [fish](https://fishshell.com/) and [Starship](https://github.com/starship/starship) for a visually appealing command-line interface.  

- A unified and consistent visual theme across Hyprland, Waybar, SwayNC, and Flatpak applications, automatically syncing with the system-wide GTK theme for seamless aesthetics.  

- A collection of custom utility scripts written in shell and python, designed for system management, wallpaper automation, and workflow enhancements.  

- Regular updates and ongoing refinements to continuously enhance functionality, stability, and the overall user experience.
